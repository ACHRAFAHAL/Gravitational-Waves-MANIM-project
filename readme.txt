#GRAVITATIONAL WAVES ( A MANIM project )

This physics project aims to simplify the complex phenomenon of gravitational waves. The final result is a ~4-minute video explaining the fascinating projects LIGO and Virgo that detected GW and the physics behind them. The video was created using the Manim library, a powerful tool for mathematical animations.

A special shoutout goes to Grant Sanderson, the creator of the Manim library. His YouTube channel 3Blue1Brown is an incredible resource for anyone passionate about mathematics. Check it out: https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown.

I also got inspired from a similar project: https://gitlab.com/ccahilla/manim_projects.This project is way better if you are looking for in depth explinations and theory. 

##Important: The different code output videos were combined in an other editing software. The software was used to add effects and for easy editing as it can be hard to write everything in Manim.
