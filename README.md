# Gravitational Waves (A Manim Project)

This project aims to simplify the complex phenomenon of **gravitational waves (GW)**. The final result is a [**4-minute animation**](https://achrafahal.github.io/Gravitational-Waves-MANIM-project/) explaining the groundbreaking work of the **LIGO** and **Virgo** collaborations that detected gravitational waves, along with the physics behind them. The video was created using **Manim**, a library for mathematical animations.

### Special Thanks
A special shoutout to **Grant Sanderson**, the creator of the **Manim** library. His YouTube channel, [**3Blue1Brown**](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown), is an invaluable resource for anyone passionate about mathematics and animation. Make sure to check it out!

### Inspiration
This project was inspired by a similar initiative found here: [**Manim Projects by Ccahilla**](https://gitlab.com/ccahilla/manim_projects). If you're looking for more in-depth explanations and theory, I highly recommend checking it out!

### Important Note
The video outputs generated from the Manim code were edited together using an external video editing software. This was necessary to add effects and facilitate the editing process, as working with all elements directly in Manim can be challenging.
